# Tab-Section

Tabs act as the highest-order sections or categories; they are purposefully broad so the user can gradually channel into the user interface to access more specific content without having to scan all of the available contents a site has to offer at once.

You can then use JavaScript to add the necessary functionality to the tabs.

You can then use CSS to style the tabs and customize their appearance.
